# Transportation System Project

## Project Description
This project develops a transportation system designed to efficiently coordinate the movement of people, goods, and vehicles.
It encompasses various modes of transport and aims to optimize routes, reduce costs, and improve delivery times.

### Key Functionalities
- **User Registration:** Allows new users to sign up.
- **User Profile Management:** Enables users to update their details.
- **Driver Information:** Provides details about drivers.
- **Payment Methods:** Adds and updates payment options like cash, Visa, or MasterCard.
- **Vehicle Listing:** Displays different types of vehicles available.
- **Trip Details:** Offers comprehensive trip information including driver and vehicle specifics, ride time, and fees.
- **Ride Ratings:** Collects user feedback on rides.
- **Ride History:** Maintains a record of all rides for each user.
- **Promo Codes:** Accepts promotional codes for discounts.
- **Ride Booking:** Facilitates the booking of rides.

## Project Queries
The system answers several key queries:
- Areas with the highest/lowest ride requests.
- Drivers with the most rides.
- Detailed driver profiles and ride counts.
- Drivers rated at least 4.5 out of 5.
- Drivers with no rides in the last month.
- Most requested vehicle type.

## General Requirements
The project follows these steps:

### 1. Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
The ERD was created to visualize the data model and its relationships, ensuring it supports the project's queries.

### 2. Physical Model (DDL Scripts)
The ERD was translated into a physical database model using Data Definition Language (DDL) scripts to establish the database schema.

### 3. SQL Queries + screenshots of the results
SQL statements were written to retrieve data according to the project's queries, allowing for meaningful insights and reports.

### 4. This project was created using a variety of tools and technologies that facilitated the design, development, and management of the transportation system database:

- **ERDPlus**: An online tool used for creating Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) to model the database schema. It helped in visualizing the relationships between different data entities.
  - Link: 

- **SQL Server 2022**: The database management system used to store, retrieve, and manage the data within the transportation system. It provided a robust and secure environment for handling transactional data.

- **SQL Language**: The standard language for managing and manipulating databases. SQL was used to create the database schema, insert data, and query the database to answer the project's inquiries.

These tools were integral to the successful implementation of the transportation system project, ensuring efficient data handling and retrieval.
