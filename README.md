- Drivers with the most rides.
- Detailed driver profiles and ride counts.
- Drivers rated at least 4.5 out of 5.
- Drivers with no rides in the last month.

## General Requirements
The project follows these steps:

### 1. Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
The ERD was created to visualize the data model and its relationships, ensuring it supports the project's queries.

### 2. Physical Model (DDL Scripts)
The ERD was translated into a physical database model using Data Definition Language (DDL) scripts to establish the database schema.

### 3. SQL Queries
SQL statements were written to retrieve data according to the project's queries, allowing for meaningful insights and reports.
